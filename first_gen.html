            <img src="images/FirstGen1.png" alt="Group of five students sitting on chairs in a panel event.">
            <p>The First-Generation Student Program is grounded in a history of student activism. First-Generation College Students @UM, 
                a student organization, was founded in 2007 with the mission to increase accessibility to resources for first-generation 
                students and to build community among the population. The students advocated for greater campus support for themselves 
                and other peer first-generation students. In 2017, University of Michigan hired the inaugural first First-Generation 
                Program Manager, established the First-Generation Gateway Office, and launched multiple initiatives to increase first-generation 
                student success. As a result, student engagement has increased significantly since 2017 and University of Michigan’s 
                first-generation efforts have received national recognition.</p>

            <h2>Defining "First-Generation College Student" at the University of Michigan</h2>
            <p>
                At the University of Michigan, we define first-generation college students as individuals whose parents or guardians 
                have not attained a four-year college degree. This inclusive definition applies to both undergraduate and graduate 
                students. While the University of Michigan adheres to this definition, all signature events organized by the 
                University of Michigan’s First-Generation Student Gateway are accessible to any student who believes these resources 
                could benefit them.
            </p>

                The term “first-generation” was initially coined within TRIO Support Services to underscore the unique challenges 
                faced by students with multiple intersecting identities as they embark on their higher education journey 
                (Jehangir & Romasanta, 2021). This terminology seeks to shed light on the fact that the structures of higher 
                education were not originally designed with the needs of first-generation college students in consideration. The 
                services and programs developed in response to this term aim to provide support to students encompassing all aspects 
                of their identities, with a primary objective of enhancing accessibility to higher education for all.</p>

            <h2>To Be a FirstGen Student</h2>
            <img src="images/FirstGen2.png" alt="Two students holding up '1ST GEN' cards">
            <p>It takes courage and determination to break new ground and try new things, to be FIRST. This includes being among 
                the first in your family to attend and graduate from college.  While going off to college can be challenging for 
                all students, it can be especially intimidating for even the bravest first gens.</p>
